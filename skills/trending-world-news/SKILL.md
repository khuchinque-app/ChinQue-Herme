# Wikipedia Trending World News — Today

## Purpose

Return today's trending world news as Wikipedia frames it: a small set of editorially curated headlines (from `Template:In_the_news`, the same items shown on the Main Page "In the news" box) plus a fuller list of today's events organized by category (from the dated `Portal:Current_events` subpage). Output is a single JSON object keyed by `date`, `top_headlines`, `categories`, and source URLs. Read-only — never edits or posts anything.

## When to Use

- "What's trending in world news on Wikipedia today?"
- A morning-briefing agent that wants a calmer, more curated alternative to algorithmic news feeds (Wikipedia ITN updates a few times per day, vetted by ITN editors).
- A research agent that wants today's events bucketed by topic (`Business and economy`, `Disasters and accidents`, `Law and crime`, `Politics and elections`, `Armed conflicts and attacks`, `Sports`, etc.) — the portal subpage groups items that way.
- Cross-checking what a mainstream-media outlet is leading with vs. what Wikipedia's volunteer editors deem significant.

## Workflow

The recommended path is the **MediaWiki public API** — no auth, no cookies, no anti-bot Verified, no Browserbase session needed. Two HTTP requests to `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php` are sufficient. Browser navigation is a fallback that costs a Browserbase session quota and gives the same data.

### 1. Compute today's date in Wikipedia's portal-subpage format

The portal subpage title is `Portal:Current_events/{YYYY}_{Month}_{D}`, where:

- `{YYYY}` is the 4-digit year.
- `{Month}` is the full English month name (`January`, `February`, …, `December`) — **not** zero-padded number.
- `{D}` is the day of month, **not zero-padded** (so `5`, `18`, `31` — `05` will 404).

Use UTC, not local time, to match Wikipedia's clock. Example for today (2026-05-18): `Portal:Current_events/2026_May_18`.

```bash
TODAY_PORTAL=$(date -u +'%Y_%B_%-d')   # → 2026_May_18
```

### 2. Fetch today's portal subpage as wikitext

Wikitext is much easier to parse than HTML (categories are wrapped in `'''bold'''` and bullets start with `*`). Use the MediaWiki `parse` action:

```
GET https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php
    ?action=parse
    &page=Portal:Current_events/{TODAY_PORTAL}
    &format=json
    &prop=wikitext
```

Through Browserbase Fetch:

```bash
export BROWSERBASE_API_KEY="$BB_API_KEY"
browse cloud fetch \
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=parse&page=Portal:Current_events/${TODAY_PORTAL}&format=json&prop=wikitext"
```

The response is a Browserbase envelope; the page wikitext is in `JSON.parse(envelope.content).parse.wikitext['*']`. The body shape is:

```
{{Current events|year=2026|month=05|day=18|content=
<!-- All news items below this line -->
'''Business and economy'''
*[[Australia–China relations]]
**[[Australia]]n treasurer [[Jim Chalmers]] orders … [https://hongkongfp.com/… (AFP via HKFP)]

'''Disasters and accidents'''
*At least 13 people are killed … [https://www.news18.com/… (CNN-News18)]
…
<!-- All news items above this line -->}}
```

### 3. Parse wikitext into `categories`

- Each `'''Category Name'''` line opens a new category bucket.
- Lines starting with `*` (single asterisk) are first-level bullets — either standalone events or topic-header bullets (a wiki-link with no sentence).
- Lines starting with `**` (two asterisks) are sub-bullets that describe the parent topic. **Fold sub-bullets into their parent** when the parent is just a wiki-link header (no terminal punctuation, < ~80 chars): emit one combined string `"{Parent topic}: {Sub-bullet text}"`. If the parent bullet is already a full sentence, emit it as-is and treat sub-bullets as siblings.
- Strip wiki markup before emitting:
  - `[[Page|Display]]` → `Display`
  - `[[Page]]` → `Page`
  - `'''bold'''` → `bold` (strip the triple-quotes; ITN sometimes bolds key phrases)
  - `''italic''` → `italic`
  - `[https://url (Source name)]` → `(Source name)` (keep the parenthesized source citation; drop the URL)
  - `[https://url text]` → `text`
- Ignore lines starting with `<!--`, `{{`, `}}`, or blank — those are template wrappers.

### 4. Fetch the curated `Template:In_the_news` headlines

ITN sits on the Main Page and is what most readers think of as "Wikipedia's trending news." It's a separately-edited template with 3–5 curated headlines from the last several days (not necessarily today). Same API:

```
GET https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php
    ?action=parse
    &page=Template:In_the_news
    &format=json
    &prop=text          # ← use rendered HTML here, not wikitext
```

Use rendered HTML for ITN (not wikitext): the template includes `{{In the news/footer | currentevents = … | recentdeaths = … }}` blocks that are messy to parse from raw markup but cleanly separated in the rendered output. The lead headlines are the top-level `<ul><li>…</li></ul>` items appearing **before** the `<h2 id="…ongoing">` / `<h2 id="…recent_deaths">` sub-headers; the "ongoing" and "recent deaths" lists come after.

A simple extraction: grab the first 5 `<li>…</li>` matches from the response, strip HTML tags, html-unescape — these are the curated headlines. Skip the inner `<ul>` sub-lists inside `recentdeaths`/`currentevents` blocks (they're shorter strings without a terminal period, easy to filter out by length+content).

### 5. Optional: pageviews "what's trending" signal

If "trending" should include *what readers are clicking on* (not just what editors curated), add a third call to the Wikimedia pageviews API:

```
GET https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/metrics/pageviews/top/en.wikipedia/all-access/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}
```

This returns the top 1000 most-viewed pages on English Wikipedia for the given day. Filter out housekeeping pages (`Main_Page`, `Special:Search`, `Wikipedia:*`) and you get a real-time view of which articles are surging — often a leading indicator that an event is breaking before ITN editors curate it. Returns within a few hours' lag from real-time. Same `browse cloud fetch` path; no auth.

### 6. Assemble output

Merge into a single JSON object — see the **Expected Output** section. Cite source URLs for each surface so downstream agents can deep-link a user to the Wikipedia page.

### Browser fallback

If the MediaWiki API is unreachable (very rare — Wikipedia's API has multi-9s uptime and serves billions of requests/day), fall back to navigating the rendered pages directly:

```bash
sid=$(browse cloud sessions create --keep-alive | jq -r .id)
export BROWSE_SESSION="$sid"

# Main Page (ITN box is in the right column under "In the news")
browse open "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" --remote
browse wait load --remote
browse get markdown body --remote | sed -n '/^## In the news/,/^## On this day/p'

# Today's portal subpage
TODAY_PORTAL=$(date -u +'%Y_%B_%-d')
browse open "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/${TODAY_PORTAL}" --remote
browse wait load --remote
browse get markdown body --remote

browse cloud sessions update "$sid" --status REQUEST_RELEASE
```

`browse get markdown body` returns a clean markdown rendering with the category headings as `###` and the bullets as `-` — easier to parse than HTML but slower and costlier than the API path (one session + 2 page loads vs. 2 raw HTTP calls).

No Verified or proxies are required for either path. Wikipedia explicitly welcomes bots that follow the [API etiquette guidelines](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Etiquette) — set a descriptive `User-Agent` if making many requests, and keep concurrency low.

## Site-Specific Gotchas

- **The portal subpage day-of-month is not zero-padded.** `Portal:Current_events/2026_May_5` exists; `Portal:Current_events/2026_May_05` returns a "page does not exist" stub. Use `date -u +'%-d'` (GNU) or `date -u +'%e' | tr -d ' '` (BSD), **not** `%d`. The month name is the full English name (`May`, not `5` or `05` or `MAY`).
- **Use UTC, not local time.** The portal page rolls over at 00:00 UTC. A request made at 23:30 UTC for "today" in a positive-offset timezone will hit the right page; the same request from an agent that uses local time may try a future-dated page that doesn't exist yet (or worse, hit yesterday's stale page after UTC midnight).
- **Future-dated portal subpages return a 200 OK with empty content (no error).** The MediaWiki parse API returns a valid JSON envelope with `parse.wikitext['*']` containing only the `{{Current events|year=…|month=…|day=…|content=}}` wrapper and no bullets. Detect this by counting bullets — if zero events parsed AND the date is `> now_utc`, the page hasn't been written yet (try yesterday's). If zero events AND date is `<= now_utc` early in the UTC morning, the page may not have its first edit yet — try the previous day.
- **ITN bullets are typically 1–3 days old, not "today."** `Template:In_the_news` is editorially curated, not auto-rolling. The headlines you read at any given moment are usually from items posted across the previous 24–72 hours; some stay up longer. Don't claim ITN bullets are "today's news" — frame them as "Wikipedia's currently-featured headlines." Use the portal subpage when you specifically need today's events.
- **ITN includes "Ongoing" and "Recent deaths" sub-lists which are not headlines.** The rendered template has 3 sections — lead headlines, then an `Ongoing` block (Iran war, Russo-Ukrainian war, Sudanese civil war — long-running stories), then a `Recent deaths` block (6 names, no description). The lead headlines are the top-level `<li>`s before any `<h2>`. The "ongoing" entries are 1–3 words each (no terminal period) and the recent-deaths entries are just names — they're easy to filter by length + the absence of a sentence-ending period, or by detecting the `<h2 id="…ongoing">` separator and only keeping `<li>`s before it.
- **Sub-bullet structure is inconsistent across categories.** Some categories use the `*topic-link\n**sub-bullet-detail` pattern (Politics, Business commonly); other categories put the full sentence on the `*` line with no `**` sub-bullets (Disasters, Law). A parser that only emits `*` lines drops the actual content for Politics-style entries; a parser that only emits `**` lines drops the content for Disasters-style entries. Walk the wikitext top-down, hold the most recent `*` line in a "pending topic" buffer, and flush as `"{topic}: {sub}"` whenever a `**` arrives; flush the `*` standalone when the next `*`, `'''`, or end-of-content hits without a `**` in between.
- **Source citations are in square-bracket external-link syntax, not native wiki templates.** Each bullet ends with `[https://example.com/article (Source Name)]` or `[https://example.com/article Source Name]`. To preserve attribution, regex-extract `\[https?://\S+\s+(?:\(([^)]+)\)|([^\]]+))\]` and keep the parenthesized name or trailing text as the `source` field. To preserve the original URL, capture the full bracketed group before stripping.
- **Wikitext is much easier than rendered HTML for the portal page.** The rendered HTML embeds `<style>` blocks, a navbar with edit/history/watch links, ARIA region wrappers, and `class="current-events-content-heading"` divs that don't always appear as expected (today's portal omitted them entirely — the categories were only in `'''bold'''` wikitext). Always pull `prop=wikitext` for the portal subpage. For ITN, the opposite is true — pull `prop=text` (rendered HTML) because wikitext has nested templates (`{{In the news/footer}}`) that are simpler to read after expansion.
- **No anti-bot at all on api.wikipedia.org.** No CAPTCHAs, no rate-limit blocks at reasonable volumes, no User-Agent sniffing that rejects requests (though [the API etiquette page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Etiquette) asks you to set a descriptive UA). Browserbase `--proxies` or `--verified` flags are not needed — bare HTTP from any IP works. The skill was developed and verified with no Verified, no proxies, and a single bare `browse cloud fetch` call per surface.
- **The pageviews API has a ~24-hour lag**, sometimes more. `wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/metrics/pageviews/top/en.wikipedia/all-access/{Y}/{M}/{D}` for *today* often returns a 404 ("data not available") until the daily roll-up is processed (typically late the next day UTC). For a real-time-ish trending signal, request yesterday's date — or use the per-hour endpoint `…/per-article/en.wikipedia/all-access/all-agents/{article}/hourly/…` for a specific article. Don't depend on pageviews for "what broke in the last hour."
- **`Portal:Current_events` (unsuffixed) shows the last ~7 days, not today.** That redirect lands on a transclusion of the last week's subpages all stacked together. Don't parse it for "today's events" — you'll mix in yesterday and the day before. Always use the dated subpage `Portal:Current_events/{Year}_{Month}_{Day}`.
- **`User-Agent` should be descriptive.** Wikimedia explicitly requests it ([policy](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_policy)) and will throttle or eventually block anonymous `python-requests/2.x` or empty UAs. `browse cloud fetch` sets a Browserbase UA by default which is acceptable; if you raw-`curl`, include something like `MyAgent/1.0 (https://example.com; bot@example.com)`.

## Expected Output

A single JSON object. The `top_headlines` array is `Template:In_the_news` lead bullets (curated, 0–5 items, frequently 1–3 days old). The `categories` object is today's portal subpage events, bucketed by editor-assigned category. Optional `trending_pageviews` is the day's most-viewed articles (lagged 24h). `as_of_utc` reflects the date used to address the portal subpage, not request time.

Categories that appear in the portal but have no items today should be omitted (or emitted as empty arrays — both are acceptable, agents using this skill should treat absence as "no events in that category today"). The canonical category labels used by ITN editors are: `Armed conflicts and attacks`, `Arts and culture`, `Business and economy`, `Disasters and accidents`, `Health and environment`, `International relations`, `Law and crime`, `Politics and elections`, `Science and technology`, and `Sports` — though not all appear every day. Always read category names from the wikitext rather than hardcoding the list.

Edge cases the consumer should be ready for:

- Empty `top_headlines` (rare — ITN almost always has at least one bullet, but it can lag during slow news cycles).
- Empty `categories` (the portal subpage exists with zero events — happens early UTC morning before the first edit lands; retry against `today - 1 day` if you need non-empty data).
- Missing `trending_pageviews` (the pageviews endpoint 404s on today's date until the daily roll-up is processed — degrade gracefully, return only `top_headlines` + `categories`).
- Wikitext that includes unexpected templates (e.g., `{{Wikinews|…}}` or `{{cite news|…}}`) inline within a bullet — strip with the same `\{\{[^}]*\}\}` regex you use for the outer `{{Current events|…|content=…}}` wrapper, or accept that the rendered text may contain template-syntax fragments and emit them anyway.
